## Problems

Some free neetcode.io problems I found relative and fun to work on after going through Karpathy's lecture:
- [Gradient Descent](https://neetcode.io/problems/gradient-descent)
- [Linear Regression (Forward)](https://neetcode.io/problems/linear-regression-forward)
- [Linear Regression (Training)](https://neetcode.io/problems/linear-regression-training)
- [Neural Networks](https://neetcode.io/quiz/neural-networks)
